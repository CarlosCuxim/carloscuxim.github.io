Hi, I'm Qxim. I have a paper that says I'm a mathematician, but I have not so
much talent at that. I like programming, but I also not so good about that.

I come from Mexico, so the english is not my native language, probably this
blog is full of mistakes, sorry for that.

I just want to enjoy the process of making a blog and sharing little things
I learn everyday. So maybe this blog will not have any sense.

In any case, I hope at least one person enjoy reading this so much I enjoyed
writing all posts.
